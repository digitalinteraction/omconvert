# Open Movement Conversion Program

## Overview

The *omconvert* conversion program resamples the input raw `.CWA` file (which records data at the naturally slightly-variable rate of the underlying sensor) based on the more precise timestamps that up to one sample per sector are tagged with.  For full help showing all of the algorithm command-line parameters, use the parameter `--help`.  Note that there is a default `-calibrate 1` option for auto-calibration.

There are several built-in analysis methods: these are not described in detail in this document -- see [AX3-GUI: Analysis Toolbar](https://github.com/digitalinteraction/openmovement/wiki/AX3-GUI#analysis-toolbar) for a description of the algorithms.  However, an example to produce an analysis of Signal Vector Magnitude, Cut-Points and Wear-Time Validation:

```bash
./omconvert datafile.cwa -svm-file datafile.svm.csv -wtv-file datafile.wtv.csv -paee-file datafile.paee.csv
```

The conversion process can be run as follows to generate a .WAV file and informational metadata file:

```bash
./omconvert datafile.cwa -interpolate-mode 1 -out datafile.wav -info datafile.yml
```

Where `-interpolate-mode 1` selects nearest-neighbour, `2` for linear interpolation, `3` for cubic interpolation.

The following sections describe the technical detail of these .WAV and informational metadata files.


## WAV file

The output `.wav` file uses the standard (for audio files) [.WAV file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) -- and there is plenty of documentation available for that format: [Audio File Format Specifications](http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/WAVE/WAVE.html), [WAVE PCM sound file format](http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/).

The output file contains four channels: the first three are for the X-/Y-/Z-axes respectively, and the fourth contains auxiliary data which can typically be ignored.  The format uses signed 16-bit values (values from -32768 to +32767) -- this is typically normalized to the -1 to +1 range, and then scaled by the channel scaling (which will be 8 for the +/-2, 4 or 8*g* range; and 16 for the +/-16*g* range -- where 1*g* is 9.81m/s/s).

The output file headers are padded so that the underlying data always starts at a fixed 1kB (1024 byte) offset.


### Metadata

#### Timestamps

The timestamp of the initial sample is given in the *Creation Date* (`ICRD`) WAV chunk, in the format `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.000`, and subsequent samples are relative to that time at the file's sample rate. This timestamp is also stored in the *Comment* chunk as the `Time` value.

Other metadata is stored in key-value pairs in other WAV file headers: each pair separated by a new line, and each key-and value separated by a colon (`:`) character (leading and trailing whitespace should be ignored).


#### Device metadata

Metadata about the device that made the recording is stored in the *Artist* 
 (`IART`) WAV chunk: the device id, device type, revision, firmware version.

```yml
Id: 1234
Device: CWA
Revision: 17
Firmware: 44
```

#### Recording metadata

Metadata about the recording itself is stored in the *Title* (`INAM`) WAV chunk: 
session identifier, recording start time, recording stop time, sensor sample rate and sensitivity and user metadata.

```yml
Session: 1
Start: 2014-08-01 10:00:00
Stop: 2014-12-08 10:00:00
Rate-A: 100,8
Metadata: 
```

#### Formatting metadata

Metadata about this WAV file is stored in the *Comment* (`ICMT`) WAV chunk: the time of the first sample, channel mapping, ranges.

```yml
Time: 2014-08-01 10:00:00.000
Channel-1: Accel-X
Scale-1: 8
Channel-2: Accel-Y
Scale-2: 8
Channel-3: Accel-Z
Scale-3: 8
Channel-4: Aux
```

The channel mapping can be used to identify the X-/Y-/Z-axes (which are currently always generated as the first/second/third three channels anyway), 
and the per-channel scaling (which is currently the same for all channels, and defaults to *8* for +/-8*g* range, and is *16* for +/-16*g* range). 
This scaling factor is for normalized sample values (in the -1 to +1 range, note that the underlying signed 16-bit integers are in the range -32768 to +32767).


### Auxiliary channel data

The 16-bit value is treated as a bit-field:

  `ncttttuu vvvvvvvv`

Where the top two bits describe the validity of the data in this sample row:

|   Bits | Values | Meaning                                               |
| -----: | -----: | :---------------------------------------------------- |
|   `nc` |     00 | Data available, no channels clipped                   |
|   `nc` |     01 | Data available, some channels clipped                 |
|   `nc` |     10 | Data not available                                    |

The next four bits describe whether this row contains additional auxiliary data:

|   Bits | Values | Meaning                                               |
| -----: | -----: | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `tttt` |   0000 | No auxiliary sample data                              |
| `tttt` |   0001 | Battery, 10-bit raw ADC reading in `uu vvvvvvvv`      |
| `tttt` |   0010 | Light, 10-bit raw ADC reading in `uu vvvvvvvv`        |
| `tttt` |   0011 | Temperature, 10-bit raw ADC reading in `uu vvvvvvvv`  |


## Return code

To make it easy for a calling application to determine whether processing completed successfully, a standard process exit code gives the reason the application terminated. 
The application should check for a zero return code from the process to indicate successfully completed the conversion and writing of the information file. 

The return code values are based on Linux `sysexits.h` `EX_` constants:

| Return code     | Value | Description                                                        |
| :-------------- | ----: | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EXIT_OK         |     0 | Successfully converted (information file and output file written)  |
| EXIT_USAGE      |    64 | Command line usage error                                           |
| EXIT_DATAERR    |    65 | Data format error (input file cannot be parsed)                    |
| EXIT_NOINPUT    |    66 | Cannot open input                                                  |
| EXIT_SOFTWARE   |    70 | Internal software error                                            |
| EXIT_OSERR      |    71 | System error                                                       |
| EXIT_CANTCREAT  |    73 | Can't create output file                                           |
| EXIT_IOERR      |    74 | Input/output error (an individual read/write failed)               |
| EXIT_CONFIG     |    78 | Configuration error                                                |


## Information File

To make it easy for a calling application to confirm certain parameters about the process or data are as expected, the conversion generates easily-consumed metadata about the conversion process and the data. 
The calling application may check the values in the information file match expectations (e.g. that the sample rate is 100Hz and +/-8g range, the requested recording duration is 7 days, start/stop times are 10am, the number of erroneous sectors is very low, the total output is 7 days, whether the auto-calibration was successful).

The metadata is written in a properties-like format (like HTML/SMTP headers, YAML subset, etc.), this is some information from the calibration process, concatenated with the existing header data from the WAV file.

## Importing the WAV file

### Overview

You should find that .WAV files are generally readable by analysis software. 
The steps are:

1. Load the .WAV file (it is typically a 4-channel, 16-bit .WAV file).
2. The relative timestamp for each sample in the .WAV file is simply sample number divided by the .WAV file's sample rate. 
3. Interpret the first three channels as the X/Y/Z acceleration data. 
The underlying signed 16-bit integers are in the range (-32768,+32767), but this may already be normalized to the range (-1,+1) -- if not, then just divide each value by 32768. 
The scaling factor is typically 8 (for +/-2/4/8g range), and only 16 for recordings made at +/-16g range. 
This normalized value is then multiplied by the scale factor -- i.e. for a scale factor of 8, the final channel data will be in the range (-8,+8). 

### Metadata

If you would like to:

* determine the true timestamp of the first sample (and, thus, the other samples)
* determine the scaling for the samples (if there are files being a mixture of +/-16g and another range)
* make use of other file metadata

...then you will need to access the file metadata.  You can access the metadata from the .WAV file headers:

1. Interpret the .WAV file comment (`ICMT` chunk) contents as ASCII text by splitting it by line (line-feed characters) to leave name/value pairs which should be split at the first colon (`:`). 
The values should then be trimmed (ignore leading/trailing white space). 
Find the `Scale-1` key, which indicates the scaling for the first channel (and will be identical for the first three channels of X/Y/Z data), which should have the text value `8` or `16` (which you should parse as a number). 
This process can be repeated for the other metadata chunks (`IART` and `INAM`).

2. Interpret the .WAV file creation date (`ICRD` chunk) as the initial sample's timestamp, in the format `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.000`. 
If this is not available, the same data is present in the `Time` name/value pair as interpreted above from the comment chunk.

If your software does not allow direct access to the .WAV file headers, you could consider exporting and reading the metadata 'information' file. 
Alternatively, then you you could read the .WAV file header chunks manually as follows (pseudo code):

```
OPEN the file for reading in a binary mode.
IF the file could not be opened, this is an error.

fileType = ReadFourBytesAsCharacters()
fileSize = ReadFourBytesAs32bitLittleEndianNumber()
IF fileType is not "RIFF", this is an error.

fileTag = ReadFourBytesAsCharacters()
If fileTag is not "WAVE", this is an error.

WHILE you are not at the end of the file:
    chunkType = ReadFourBytesAsCharacters()
    remainingChunkSize = ReadFourBytesAs32bitLittleEndianNumber()
    
    IF chunkType is "LIST":
        listTag = ReadFourBytesAsCharacters()
        remainingChunkSize = remainingChunkSize - 4
        IF listTag is "INFO":
            WHILE remainingChunkSize > 0:
                infoType = ReadFourBytesAsCharacters()
                infoSize = ReadFourBytesAs32bitLittleEndianNumber()
                info = ReadBytes(infoSize)
                remainingChunkSize = remainingChunkSize - 4 - 4 - infoSize
                IF infoType is "ICMT" or "IART" or "INAM":
                    ProcessMetadata(info)
                IF infoType is "ICRD":
                    ProcessStart(info)

    SEEK file forwards by remainingChunkSize to skip the rest of the chunk
```
